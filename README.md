[Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) is an engaging recognition and rewards platform that enriches your company culture.

But what if you don't want to create a rewarding culture of recognition and support? What if you want to rule your employees with an iron fist, instill fear, and create a workplace so toxic, [Parker Conrad himself](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/zenefits-fires-nearly-half-its-staff) would be proud?

Fret not! **Blame.ly** is here to help. Encourage a culture of backstabbing and McCarthyism on your team by gamifying the process of public shaming! Use our UX to assign your monthly blame points on your least favorite colleagues, track blames across the team, and watch stress levels go through the roof! Keep track as your own blame balance accumulates, but _beware_ - the most blamed employees might need to have a chat with the boss... you!

Oh, and if that plan doesn't work out too well, maybe give [Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) a try :)
