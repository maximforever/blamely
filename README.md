[Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) is an engaging recognition and rewards platform that enriches your company culture.

But what if you don't want to create a rewarding culture of recognition and support? What if you want to rule your employees with an iron fist, instill fear, and create a workplace so toxic, [Parker Conrad himself](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/zenefits-fires-nearly-half-its-staff) would be proud?

Fret not! **Blame.ly** is here to help. Encourage a culture of backstabbing and McCarthyism on your team by gamifying the process of public shaming your coworkers! Use our intuitive interface to assign your monthly blame points on your least favorite colleagues. Watch your own blame balance accumulate, but beware! The most blamed employees might need to talk to the boss.. you!

Oh, and if that plan goes up in flames... maybe give [Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) a try :)
