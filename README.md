[Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) is an engaging recognition and rewards platform that enriches your company culture.

But what if you don't want to create a rewarding culture of recognition and support? What if you want to rule your employees with an iron fist, instill fear, and create a culture so toxic, [Parker Conrad himself](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/02/zenefits-fires-nearly-half-its-staff) would be proud?

Fret not! **Blame.ly** is here to help. Encourage a culture of blame and fear amongst your employees by gamifying the process of backstabbing your coworkers! Use our intuitive interface to assign your monthly blame points on your least favorite colleagues. Watch your own blame balance, and beware! The most blamed employees might not be back next month.

Oh, and if that doesn't work out... maybe give [Bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly) a try :)
